- [x] Import useState from React for state management
- [x] Add state for notes array to store added notes
- [x] Add state for input values (heading and details) to make form controlled
- [x] Update submitHandler to capture input values, add new note to state, and clear form fields
- [x] Render notes list below the form with proper styling to prevent overlapping
- [x] Fix textarea classes by removing invalid flex properties
- [x] Test the app to ensure notes display without overlapping (app running on http://localhost:5174/)
